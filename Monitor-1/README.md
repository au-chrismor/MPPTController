# Monitor-1
This project measures the battery voltage and current as described in the article:

It is mostly an example of how to read the sensors, and act on voltage levels.  While it doesn't do anything terribly *useful*, it does give you an insight into the charging values of your cell(s) and battery.

Enjoy!
